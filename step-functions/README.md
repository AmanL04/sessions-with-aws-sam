# AWS Step Functions

In this session, viewers learn how to use AWS SAM to create and deploy AWS Step Functions workflows in their serverless applications. A basic overview of Step Functions is provided. Standard Workflows and Express Workflows are introduced and compared. Nested workflows are introduced for composing complex state machines from basic building blocks. A sample state machine is built using AWS SAM and the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code. Finally, we review what the viewer has learned and conclude the livestream.
